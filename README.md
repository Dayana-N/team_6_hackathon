## User Experience

##### Target Audience

- People who enjoy playing online games. 
- Those who don't have or do not wish to have a counterpart to play with.

##### First Time Visitors Goals

As a firs time user,

- I can easily understand and follow the simple rules of the game.
- I get instant positive feedback while playing the game.
- I don't have to organize an opponent player to play the game so I can enjoy playing the game by myself.

##### Returning Visitors Goals

As a returning visitor, 
- I enjoy getting more positive feedback as I practice more to play the game.
- I still find the game exciting because I am constantly improving my skills.

##### Frequent Visitors Goals

As a frequent visitor, 
- I can play a visually appealing game to pass time in a fun way and/or to clear my head between long working sessions.

##### Scope

## Design

##### Colour Scheme

The color scheme was detected from the hero image and chosen to create a warm and harmonious atmosphere.

![color-palette](./documentation/color-palette.png)

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-3d2617) was used to validate color contrast for web accessibility in terms of readability.

##### Fonts

[Rototo slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=roboto+slab) was chosen as the primary font for a classy look with a focus on readability. The font is variable and offers a range of weights, making it suitable for various design elements.

##### Wireframes

## Agile Methodology

This project utilizes Agile Development Methods to manage development and ensure efficient delivery.

##### Overview

##### EPICS (Milestones)

The epics represent the high-level objectives and functionalities of the project. These can be further divided into granular tasks, as defined in the user stories. 

##### User Stories Issues

Detailed descriptions that outline the project's functionalities from the user's perspective. 

For details to the Epics and User Stories, please visit the project's [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Mickjitsu/projects/3).

##### The MoSCoW Prioritization Method

The acronym stands for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. To effectively manage resources and development flow, based on urgency and necessity, the prioritization method MoSCoW was employed. 

A structural approach to determine which features are essential for the current stage (Must Have), which can be incorporated if time allows (Should Have), which might be deferred for later iterations (Could Have), and which are excluded from this iteration or unlikely to be implemented (Won't Have). 
The priorities are reflected with **labels** on each user story on [this project's Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Mickjitsu/projects/3)
